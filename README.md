# Spider Demo

The repository contains the source code for a short demo project using the Spider language. Spider is a natural extension to JavaScript and gives us some interesting features.

## Building the demo

To compile the script you only need to apply the following command:

	spider -c main.spider

This will create a file called *main.js*, which is used in the *index.html* file. Additionally the *main.map* file is generated, which contains the source map to relate the JavaScript file to the original Spider file.

## License

The sample code uses an MIT License (MIT). For more information have a look at the *LICENSE* file.
